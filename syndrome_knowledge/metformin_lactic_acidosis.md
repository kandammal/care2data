SYNDROME: Metformin-Associated Lactic Acidosis (MALA)

DRUGS:
- Metformin (Biguanide)

KEY SYMPTOMS:
- Dyspnea
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Myalgia
- Weakness
- Confusion

RISK FACTORS:
- Renal impairment
- Elderly
- Dehydration
- Heart failure
- Alcohol abuse

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY:
Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I and impairs hepatic lactate clearance, leading to lactic acid accumulation, especially in renal dysfunction.

DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS:
- Elevated serum lactate
- Metabolic acidosis (low pH, low bicarbonate)
- Elevated creatinine

CLINICAL ACTION:
- Immediate discontinuation of metformin
- ABG, lactate, renal function
- IV bicarbonate
- Hemodialysis in severe cases

SEVERITY:
Life-threatening (30–50% mortality untreated)
